# Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Transaction Monitoring Dashboard

## üóÇÔ∏è Introduction

This project introduces an end-to-end Anti-Money Laundering Transaction Monitoring Dashboard designed to detect, investigate, and visualize suspicious financial activity. The solution leverages Power BI and IBM‚Äôs synthetic AML dataset to simulate realistic scenarios involving anomalous transactions, high-risk merchants and customers, and peak risk periods.

- **Objective:**  
  Monitor and analyze financial transactions to detect potential money laundering, including unusual patterns, high-risk entities, and periods of heightened activity among customers, merchants, and banks.

- **Key Highlights:**  
  - Innovative use of dynamic KPIs for total suspicious activity, flagged entities, and risk distribution.
  - Drillthrough pages offering in-depth breakdowns for merchants and banks.
  - Time-based trends to surface suspicious behavior patterns.
  - Advanced Power BI features: interactive tooltips, dynamic navigation, and star schema modeling.

- **Built With:**  
  Power BI Desktop, IBM synthetic AML CSV datasets, DAX, and Star Schema modeling principles.

## üìÇ Dataset Source

- **IBM Watsonx Synthetic AML Dataset (CSV format; Available in Kaggle)**
- **Files Used:**
  - `transactions_HI.csv`, `transactions_LI.csv`
  - `patterns_HI.csv`, `patterns_LI.csv`
  - `amounts_HI.csv`, `amounts_LI.csv`

## üèóÔ∏è Data Modeling Steps

- **Merged Transactions & Patterns**
  - The `patterns` tables contained all columns of `transactions`, plus additional pattern-specific fields.
  - Both High Intensity (HI) and Low Intensity (LI) transaction and pattern datasets were merged to create a single consolidated fact table: `FactTransactions`.

- **Combined Account Details**
  - HI and LI versions of the `amounts` table were merged to produce a unified `DimAccount` dimension table.

- **Created Date Table**
  - An independent `DimDate` dimension was created, containing a complete date hierarchy.
  - The `TransactionDate` field in `FactTransactions` is related to the `DateKey` in `DimDate`.

- **Dual Roleplaying Dimension**
  - `DimAccount` was duplicated to serve as both `DimAccount_From` and `DimAccount_To`, representing both sender and receiver contexts.
  - Each dimension was appropriately linked to `FactTransactions` to model transaction origin and destination.

- **Schema Design**
  - The entire model is structured as a classic **Star Schema**:
    - **Fact Table:** `FactTransactions`
    - **Dimensions:** `DimDate`, `DimAccount_From`, `DimAccount_To`
